# hbnb: An AirBnB Clone for Learning
This project, hbnb, is an educational recreation of the popular AirBnB website built as part of the ALX Software Engineering program.  It mimics the core functionalities of the original, including a user interface for browsing and booking rentals, a powerful backend handling data management, a well-defined API facilitating communication between frontend and backend, and a robust database for persistent storage.  Furthermore, to enhance development and debugging, an interactive console is included, allowing you to directly interact with the backend using intuitive commands.

**\*\*The project is still under development and currently only implements the console and static webpages.\*\***

## Contents:
* [The Console](#the-console)
* [Web Static](#web-static)

### The Console
The console facilitates interaction with the backend using intuitive commands.\
Here is the list of available commands:
* `help`: Shows a list of available commands and displays their docs.
* `quit/EOF`: Exits the console.
* `all`: Prints the string representation of all objects' instances.
* `count`: Retrieves the number of instances of a class.
* `create`: Creates a class instance.
* `destroy`: Delete an instance of a class.
* `show`: Shows an instance.
* `update`: Updates an attribute of an instance based on the class name and id.

### Web Static
The `web_static` directory houses the foundational elements that bring hbnb's user interface to life. Here, you'll find the HTML and CSS files meticulously crafted to prototype the various screens and functionalities that users will encounter when interacting with your AirBnB clone. This section serves as the blueprint for the visual experience, ensuring a user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing web application.
